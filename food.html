          Since I moved out of Kurdistan, beside missing my family, friends, and
          nature in Kurdistan Bashur, I miss the food the most. I miss the taste
          of vegetables and fruits back home. I miss the meals and the family
          gatehring around the table. I miss breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and
          desserts. I miss the smell of fresh bread and the gathering around the
          table that are not so common in this part of the world where I live
          today. I am getting hungery writing this.

          Let me take you on a food tour. This might be similar to food in
          neighbouring countries, but each have their own way of adding spice
          which makes it different. First things first, breakfast. We in
          Kurdistan are not used to eating cereal and milk for breakfast. This
          trend is relatively new and only practiced by very few individuals and
          mostly frowned upon. A typical Kurdish breakfast usually consiste of
          eggs, cheese, yogurt, cream, honey, walnuts, beans, warm bread, and
          black tea. The combination varies depending on the region. I for one
          never had beans for breakfast until I was 28 years old when I went out
          for breakfast with friends at a resturant in old town in Erbil,
          Kurdistan. It is true that each household will have their own
          combination of the items mentioned above, however, there is never just
          one item and there is always tea. The picture you see beside this
          paraghraph is how breakfast usually look in kurdish households.

          Now let's talk about the Kurdish cuisines. There is a big difference
          between everyday food in Kurdish household and occasion cuisine or
          holidays. Daily kurdish food consist of mainly rice, a soup, beef or
          chicken (if affordable), and salad. This is called Brinj o Afik/Brinj
          u Shla The most common type of rice is kurish rice, which has a
          slightly smaller size compared to that of basmati rice and has a
          richer flavour—I never liked it, but majority of the Kurds love it.
          The most common type of soup is beans soup with beef or beef broth.
          The most common type of salad is that of cucummber and tomates with
          pomegranate sauce.

        <p>
          Kurds have many cuisine that you see made suring the weekends, when
          guests are around, and in special occasions. These can vary. I would
          say the most popular and common foods are Biryani, Yaprax/Dolma,
          Tershik/Kifta, and Shifta. Biryani is not a new food nor special to
          only Kurds, but it is a popular easy to make delicious food. In
          kurdistan, Biryani is usually made by mixing rice with fried almonds,
          chicken, raisens (unfortunetly), and some mis potatos, carrots, and
          peas. See the picture to the right of this paraghraph. If you like to

        <h1><span> Dolma</span></h1>
        <p>
          Kurdish Dolma is basically vegtables stuffed with rice and beef. It
          sounds very easy when I put it like this, but this is a time consuming
          cuisine. You would need to prepare various vegetables by boiling,
          cutting, and removing the insides for them to be stuffed. Then you
          need to cook the rice and the beef with paresley, garlice, tomato
          puree, and spices. Kuridish people like the dolma to be spicy and
          sour, therefore, there is a lot of lemon and chilli involved. If you
          want to make Kurdish Dolma,

        <p>
          Turn to talk about my favourate food, Kifta or as we call it Tirshik.
          This dish is the only dish I would ever ask for whenever I am going
          back home or when anyone asks me what I want them to cook for me. It
          is the best and it is also time consuming. It is basically dumpling
          soup if you want to see it in simple terms. It is made by stuffing
          jarish with with beef that has been fried with onions, parsely, and
          spices. Then boiling them in a tomato and vegetable soup, depending on
          the household different vegetables are added int eh soup. If you want
          to learn how to make kifta,

          All of this and we have not talked about the sweets. In kurdistan,
          cake is not a typical desert. Usually a desert is some baked pasteries
          such as Kada/Kulecha or some of the more internationally famous
          deserts like Baklava and Kunafa. Kada are made in every Kurdish and
          Iraqi household at least twice a year during Eid Al Fitr and Eid Al
          Adha. My favourate are the ones stuffed with dates. They are usually
          stuffed with grated cocunut, walnuts, and sesames.

        <p>
          Finally, Baklava. Since this one doesn't need introduction. It is
          available everywhere in the world and has various types that have
          unique looks and flavours. I won't say much more and just share a
          picture.
