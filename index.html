          Kurdistan is a region in the Middle East. Kurdistan is a region
          divided by the borders of four countries. Kurds call the four parts by
          their cardinal directions: Bakur (North), Bashur (South), Rojava
          (West), Rojhelat (East). Bakur is in southeastern Turkey. I am from
          Bashur, which lies in northern Iraq. Rojava is in northern Syria. The
          last part, Rojhalat is in northwestern Iran. All four parts of
          Kurdistan have amazing nature and a lot of historical cites due to the
          diverse geographical location but also the historical context and
          ethno-religious diversity. I have lived all my life in Bashur and thus
          I would like to show you some of the thing you might want to do if you
          are to visit Kurdistan's Bashur.

        </div>
        <p>
          Before talking about what to do, let me walk you through the
          geoghraphy of Kurdistan Bashur. In Bashur, there are four
          governorates: Duhok, Erbil/Hawler, Sulaymaniyah/Slemani, and Halabja.
          Each of these governorates have a capital city carrying the same name
          as the governorate.
        </p>
        <h1>Duhok</h1>
        <p>
          I am from Duhok city, in Duhok governorate. Duhok city is a valley
          area between two moutnain chains. Duhok is known for its beautiful
          nature and hospitable people. As a tourist in Duhok, you might want to
          take a hike in one of the closeby mountians that can be a 5 to 10
          minutes walk from your hotel depending on where you stay. Duhok also
          has a dam which can be viewed from the mountian and can be driven to
          from almost anywhere in Duhok within 30 minutes. If you are not a
          nature or hiking person. There is always museums and downtown to see
          the bazar and enjoy food, traditional goods, and music. There are a
          varity of food options and bars.

        <h1>Erbil</h1>
        <p>
          Erbil is the capital of Kurdistan Bashur and the biggest city in
          Bashur. I lived in Erbil for 5 years and I would say if you like the
          big city life, Erbil is the place to go. Erbil is a more dry land with
          no mountians or much of forst surrounding it. It is an industrial and
          fast growning city. Erbil is known for its tall building, beautiful
          historical cites such as the Hawler Citadel, and its vibrance
          especially in Ainkawa, downtown, and Bazar areas. In Erbil, you can
          visit the different parks and see the mounaments in each park. You can
          visit downtowna and see the historical Hawler citadel while shoping
          from your local stores and getting traditional sourveniurs. Erbil has
          an international community due to the growing buinesses, international
          organizations, and local and international companies. There are a
          varity of international resturants, bars, and clubs. There are also
          small communities that organizes sport events, parties, and more. See

        </div>
        <h1>Sulaymaniyah</h1>
        <p>
          Sulaymaniyah is similar in nature to Duhok and similar in size and
          advancement to Erbil. It is a mix of both world. I ahve only visited
          Sulaymaniyah a few times, but I can tell that if you like nautre and
          enjoy the vibes of a big city, that is where you need to be.
          Sulaymaniayh has a vibrant cultural ambience in it bazars with more
          nature. In Sulaymaniyah, you might want to also visit the mountians in
          the city and see the city view from above. You can enjoy a stroll in
          the busy bazar area or sit in a cafe with friends and disucss pressing
          matters.

        </div>
        <h1>Halabja</h1>
        <p>
          Last but not least, Halabja. I have been to Halabja one time. It is
          the smallest of the goernorates and the cities. It is also the most
          recent to become a governorate. Halabja is the city that suffered from
          a chemical attack during Sadam Hussien's presidency and it is most
          known for its Memorial Monoumnet to commemorate the martyrs.

        <h1>Outdoors</h1>
        <p>
          During my time there I used to go on various hiking and camping trips
          and would like to share some pictures of some the various places I
          have been to in Bashur. Bashur has beautiful mountanous areas, but
          that is not all that it offers, it also has rivers, waterfalls, and
          caves among others. On your hikes, tubing, rafting, and camping trips,
          you will pass by villages and see wild and domestic animals wondering
          around and enjoying nature. We also hold parties in the mountains and
          by the rivers some of those are parties plus camping as the parties go
          on for two days. Nature is not the only think Kurdistan's Bashur
          offers. Bashur have developed cities that are filled with tall
          buildings, malls, resturants, and similar places. It also has various
          historical cities within and around each of the cities. Bashur also
          has culutral events and holidays during which you might want to visit
          such as the Kurdish New Year on March 21st.
        </p>

          If you are interested in going on various trips in Bashur to see
          nature or visit historical sites in Bashur and in Iraq, you can

          cities of Bashur and to Ninevah province. Each time, it was a great
          trip where I learned new facts about places that I might have been to
          before or about new places. For rafting and Kayaking or tubing you can
