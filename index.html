          Kurdistan is a region in the Middle East. Kurdistan is a region
          divided by the borders of four countries. Kurds call the four parts by
          their cardinal directions: Bakur (North), Bashur (South), Rojava
          (West), Rojhelat (East). Bakur is in southeastern Turkey. I am from
          Bashur, which lies in northern Iraq. Rojava is in northern Syria. The
          last part, Rojhalat is in northwestern Iran. All four parts of
          Kurdistan have amazing nature and a lot of historical cites due to the
          diverse geographical location but also the historical context and
          ethno-religious diversity. I have lived all my life in Bashur and thus
          I would like to show you some of the thing you might want to do if you
          are to visit Kurdistan's Bashur.

          During my time there I used to go on various hiking and camping trips
          and would like to share some pictures of some the various places I
          have been to in Bashur. Bashur has beautiful mountanous areas, but
          that is not all that it offers, it also has rivers, waterfalls, and
          caves among others. On your hikes, tubing, rafting, and camping trips,
          you will pass by villages and see wild and domestic animals wondering
          around and enjoying nature. We also hold parties in the mountains and
          by the rivers some of those are parties plus camping as the parties go
          on for two days. Nature is not the only think Kurdistan's Bashur
          offers. Bashur have developed cities that are filled with tall
          buildings, malls, resturants, and similar places. It also has various
          historical cities within and around each of the cities. Bashur also
          has culutral events and holidays during which you might want to visit
          such as the Kurdish New Year on March 21st.

          If you are interested in going on various trips in Bashur to see
          nature or visit historical sites in Bashur and in Iraq, you can

          on Instagram. I have been with this group on various trips in the
          cities of Bashur and to Ninevah province. Each time, it was a great
          trip where I learned new facts about places that I might have been to
          before or about new places. For rafting and Kayaking or tubing you can

          before I leave Kurdistan. They are the friendliest people and they are
          very knoweldgable. Below you can see the pictures and videos I have
          taken in different parts of Bashur. You can click on each individual
          picture to see it in its full size. You can also check the Creator
          Card for my instagram, YouTube, and LinkedIn accounts where you can
          find more pictures and videos of Bashur.
