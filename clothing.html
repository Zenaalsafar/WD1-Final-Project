        Traditional clothes is a big part of the Kurdish culture.
        Kurdish people wear their traditional clothing in their daily life,
        during celebrations, and during holidays. There is even a national
        cultural clothes day where everyone in Kurdistan wears their traditional
        clothes. That is on March 10th. On this day all the kurds perform their
        work and gathering in Kurdish clothes. It is not only the Kurds in Kurdistan
        who have their traditonal clothes and culutre. There is also the Assyrian
        and Yazidis among others. The next day when most of the Kurdish
        populaiton in Kurdistan and all over the world wear Kurdish clothes is on 
        Newroz, which is the Kurdish New Years, on March 21st. The month of March 
        is the most celebrated in Kurdistan mainly becuase of Newroz. People go out 
        with their families to picnic sites wearing their traditional clothes and
         playing and dancing on the tunes of Kurdish music.

        Kurdish clothes have more vibrant colors for women and more or less neutral colors for
        men. Women's Kurdish clothes have multiple lays and underlayers and they
        chnage based on city/tribe/religion. Men's clothing also change
        depending on city/tribe/religion, but they might not have as many layers
        similar to women's cultural clothes.
